Workflow

First, think through the problem. Read the codebase and write a plan in tasks/todo.md.

The plan should be a checklist of todo items.

Check in with me before starting work—I’ll verify the plan.

Then, complete the todos one by one, marking them off as you go.

At every step, give me a high-level explanation of what you changed.

Keep every change simple and minimal. Avoid big rewrites.

At the end, add a review section in todo.md summarizing the changes.
