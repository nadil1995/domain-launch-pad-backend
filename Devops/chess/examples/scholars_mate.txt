Opening: Scholar's Mate - A Common Beginner Trap

1. e4 - King's pawn opening
2. e5 - Black responds in kind
3. Bc4 - Bishop aims at the weak f7 square
4. Nc6 - Black develops but misses the threat
5. Qh5 - Queen joins the attack on f7
6. Nf6 - Black tries to defend but it's too late
7. Qxf7# - Checkmate! The f7 square was too weak

This demonstrates why beginners should be careful about the f7/f2 pawns - they're only defended by the king initially.
